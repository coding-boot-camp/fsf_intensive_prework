## Welcome

You are about to embark on a transformational journey that will dramatically improve your skill set. At times, it will be challenging, frustrating, and even bewildering, but trust us; it *will* be worth it in the end.

This program's curriculum is not easy. You will be exposed to new ideas at breakneck speeds and challenged to complete difficult exercises. Be prepared to push yourself and to be pushed.

That said, remember every one of us, behind the scenes, is rooting for you. You are here in this program because we believe in your potential to succeed. You will have an excellent instructor, a dedicated assistant instructor, an extremely rich curriculum, and supportive peers to nudge you forward. If you put in the time and effort, we're confident you will find the success you're looking for.

## The Importance of Prework

Because of the challenging nature of this program, we want you to come ready to sprint on Day 1. To prepare you, we've created these modules to be completed before your first day. The prework will provide you with the preliminary skills and information you'll need to begin the course. It will also give you a glimpse of what's to come. 

These sections should be completed in sequential order, as each section builds on the other. You should also complete all assignments, some of which will be fairly challenging and require outside research. 

As you work through the readings and assignments, don't be discouraged if some of them give you trouble. Just focus on doing your best. 

Good luck, have fun, and get pumped! You are in for an amazing ride.
