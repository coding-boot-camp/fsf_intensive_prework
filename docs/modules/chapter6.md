## What to Do Next

The most important thing for you to do now is to simply continue coding. You have come a long way by completing this prework, but the longer you go without coding, the harder it will be to get back into the habit. Don't let your knowledge wilt on the vine.

Becoming a successful developer is going to require a good deal of discipline and independent motivation. Begin looking for opportunities to expand your horizons. See a cool website? Inspect the source code! Have a problem in your everyday life? Try to figure out a way to solve it using logic and code. The most successful developers never cease learning or finding ways to improve.

Here are some resources that you can use to reinforce and to expand on the knowledge you've gained so far.

1. [Code School](https://www.codeschool.com)

   Code School is one of the single best websites for beginners. When you complete all of the prework modules, we strongly encourage you to review as many of Code School's lessons on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery as you can. Doing so will greatly help you during the first few weeks of class.

2. [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com)

   Codecademy is another excellent site that offers free courses on languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each course is broken up into a number of step-by-step lessons that guide you through the fundamentals and simple projects.

3. [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com)

   Complete lessons to gain certifications and gradually build a portfolio. When you finish all of your certifications, you can get real-world experience by building projects for nonprofits.
