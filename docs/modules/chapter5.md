## What Is JavaScript Testing?

To begin our discussion of testing with JavaScript, lets first define what testing means in general. Testing is checking to make sure that actual results match the expected results. We can test our applications by clicking around and checking to make sure that it is behaving as we expect it to, however this is what is referred to as `manual testing`. When we talk about JavaScript testing, we are concerned with automating this testing process through the use of scripts written in JavaScript.

## Why Do We Need To Test?

- Automated tests make development faster because you no longer need to manually check to make sure everything is behaving properly after changes to your code.
- You are less likely to make errors than with manual because it is easier to overlook bugs while manually testing.
- Testing your code makes you think more about potential errors that could occur.
- Testing your code forces you to write better, cleaner code because messy code is harder to test.

## What Are Some Types Of Tests?

- Unit Tests: These are meant to meant to test one isolated piece of code.
- Integration Tests: These are meant to test how features interact with eachother.
- End-to-End(e2e) Tests: These are meant to test an entire process in your app.
