    1. `Input`
    2. `number` variable
    3. `-` operator
    4. `Output`


2. An application that takes in two numbers and divides the first by the second if the first is less than the second. Otherwise it multiplies the two. Print the result.

    1. `Input`
    2. `number` variable
    3. `conditionals`
    4. `/` or `*` operator
    5. `Output`    

3. An application that takes in 2 numbers and a string. The character will be `"+"`, `"-"`, `"*"`, or `"/"`. Using the tools above, create a calculator that prints out the sum, difference, product, or quotient of the numbers.

5. A tic tac toe game in which the user clicks to add an O or X (depending on whose turn it is). After each turn, if there are three of a kind in a row, the winner (X or O) is printed and the game ends. 

    1. `String` variable
    2. `loops`
    3. `Input`
    4. `conditionals`
    5. `Output`
