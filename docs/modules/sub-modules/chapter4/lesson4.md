# Lesson \#4 - Further Reading

Your brain probably feels overloaded. That's a good thing. It means you're learning.

Sometimes, it's better to have a written resource that you can reference at your leisure. There are many out there, but we've chosen two books that do a good job of building JavaScript fundamentals.

### Assignment

Read through the first few chapters of each of the below books. Don't worry about trying to read it all, or even studying them too deeply. For now, just familiarize yourself chapters 1 and 2 in Eloquent JavaScript and Chapter 2 of You Don't Know JavaScript (Read up until you reach the part on `Strict Mode`). Remember to bookmark them for future reference.

- [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/)
- [You Don't Know JavaScript](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/up%20&%20going/README.md#you-dont-know-js-up--going)
