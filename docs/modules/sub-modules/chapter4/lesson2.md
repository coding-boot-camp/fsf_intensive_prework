 # Lesson \#2 - JavaScript Basics

Now that we understand how our programs will logically flow, it's time to get into the nitty-gritty of actually coding JavaScript.

We're going to hit the ground running in class, so it's important that you come into the class with a good foundation on which to build.

**codeacademy** is a great resource for people looking to learn all sorts of code.  We'll be going through the first few lessons of their JavaScript course to build that foundation that we're looking for.

If you wish to go beyond the required modules, go on with your bad self, but don't feel like it's necessary.
