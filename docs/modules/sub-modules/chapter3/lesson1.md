# Lesson \#1 - Front-end Development

Front-end development, or client-side development, is the production of what the user sees and interacts within the browser. Alternatively, Back-end development would be more concerned with the server and database. Together they comprise what is known as Full-stack development.

But don't confuse front-end development with designers! More often than not, as a front-end developer, you'll be working with designers by matching designs given to you by them to make pixel perfect copies using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the three languages of the web. Every browser (Chrome, Firefox, Explorer, Safari, etc.) uses all three. Let's take a moment to break down what each of these languages does and how they interact with each other.

**HTML**

HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the language used to write content. This includes text, links, images, and really any other basic content types.

**CSS**

CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is how we add styling and animations to our websites. CSS helps our websites come to life by adding styling whether it is font color, font weight, background images, or even dimensions! CSS is a deep topic but don't worry, getting started with CSS is easy!

**JS**

JavaScript is the logic behind the functionality behind our websites! Think of it as the language used to determine what happens when the user clicks a button or even scrolls through a page!
