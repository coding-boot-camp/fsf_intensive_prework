# Chapter \#3 - HTML and CSS

Webpages consist of 3 parts: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

HTML stands for **H**yper**T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage. It is a language that is used to add content to a webpage.

CSS stands for **C**ascading **S**tyle **S**heet. CSS determines how elements on the page are styled.

Without CSS every webpage would look like plain black text. With CSS, we can make our text blue, add borders, and position elements exactly where we want them.
